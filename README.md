This website project is relevant to showing a company's basic information for help people to find out this company easily.
1- In this project i use javascript, php, css, html.

2- Firstly i get the company's informations from company's owner.

3- These informations are come to my Adminpanel. If i accept that company's request then this company is creating in mysql and automaticly give to company "noneimage.png" images.

4- Company's owner can add image for him company and also i can check this image request again. If i accept to request then company has own image and replace to "noneimage.png" image.

5-All company can upload to 10 image. Company's can select own company's profile photo, because i create a companys place and in there all company's location showing to in map(in this section i need one picture to be company's profile but also other images are showing to in company-detail.php page.)

6- This map page i used yandex api for show them companys and if you gonna click these to icon in map, then open a like popup screen and you can see company's information (company number,  get company's navigation i use it google here because i think it is realy good for find a place better than yandex, company image)
